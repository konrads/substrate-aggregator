# DeFI Aggregator pallet

This is an implementation of a DeFI aggregator, comprising:
- parametrizable longest path algorithm
- OCW worker fetching latest price data, run the longest path algorithm, record results via extrinsics
- extrinsic interface for:
  - internal usage, eg. recording of latest price data
  - admin/root, eg. addition/deletion of price pairs (by provider)
  - trading API utilizing the latest price data

## Details
This pallet comprises following structure:
```

- [lib.rs](src/lib.rs) - OCW mechanisms and extrinsic APIs
- [types.rs](src/types.rs) - types utilized throughout
- [utils.rs](src/utils.rs) - common utils
- [heap.rs](src/heap.rs) - heap implementation
- [benchmarking.rs](src/benchmarking.rs) and [weights.rs](src/weights.rs) - weights produced by benchmarking
- [best_path_calculator/floyd_warshall](best_path_calculator/floyd_warshall) - implementation of a shortest/longest path algorithm, comprising:
  - Floyd-Warshall implementation as per https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNI0rf2P9gE&ab_channel=AbdulBari
  - longest path implementation with weight multiplications, as per https://www.coursera.org/lecture/algorithms-on-graphs/currency-exchange-reduction-to-shortest-paths-cw8Tm
- [trade_provider/crypto_compare] - price data fetcher, as lifted from OCW example

### Longest path algorithm
For longest path calculations, Floyd-Warshall algorithm was chosen for its ability to calculate shortest/longest paths across all vertices.

For multiplication based weights, it's been noticed that product maximisation is equivalent to maximisation of log of weights, as per: `x*y = 2^(log2(x) + log2(y))`.

For longest paths, weights have been multiplied by `-1` and hence reused in shortest path algorithm.

*NOTE:* Floyd-Warshall can detect negative path cycles (ie. infinite arbitrage opportunities), which cause the latest price update to be ignored. Potential FIXME - remove offending edge to remove negative cycles...

### OCW
OCW triggers price fetching, best path calculation, compares with currently stored best path and issues updates via unsigned root origin extrinsic.

OCW trigger is guarded by an `OffchainTriggerFreq` constant ensuring price fetching doesn't happen too frequently, as well as `AcceptNextOcwTxAt` storage / `UnsignedTxAcceptFreq` constant ensuring unsigned transactions are received too frequently.

### API
- admin (root origin)
  - `ocw_submit_best_paths_changes()` - for price change delta submissions from onchain
  - `add_price_pair()`/`delete_price_pair()`/`submit_price_pairs()` - for submission of to-be-monitored price pairs by provider
- public facing
  - `trade()` - to perform trade as per chosen trade path (not yet integrated with a provider)

### Storage
In flux, to-be-described...

### Events
In flux, to-be-described...

### Constants
- `OffchainTriggerFreq` - determines OCW trigger frequency
- `UnsignedTxAcceptFreq` - determines unsigned transaction receipt frequency
- `UnsignedPriority` - sets unsigned transaction priority (to play nicely with other pallets)
- `PriceChangeTolerance` - sets acceptable price change tolerance, if not breached, on-chain prices aren't updated

## Usage
```bash
make build                      # build pallet/runtime
make test                       # verify build
make clippy                     # ensure code quality

make run                        # start the project
make run-node                   # start the project, from pre-compiled node
sleep 15 && make populate-keys  # in another windowm, upload keys once the node stabilizes

```

Go to [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer). Ensure you've switched to local node:

Add offchain authority (potentially temporary step, might be automated). Click on `+ Add Account`, enter the mnemonic `clip organ olive upper oak void inject side suit toilet stick narrow`:

<img src="/docs/img/add-offchain-authority-account.png" alt="Add offchain authority account" width="60%">

Proceed by clicking `Next`, name the newly created to eg. `OCW_ADMIN`, click `Next`, `Save`.

Go to extrinsic menu:

<img src="/docs/img/extrinsic-menu.png" alt="Go to extrinsic menu" width="40%">

Add the newly created authority to the whitelist. Note, this is done via sudo call (requires going through `sudo` pallet):
<img src="/docs/img/add-whitelisted-offchain-authority.png" alt="Add whitelisted offchain authority" width="70%">

Submit submit currency-provider pairs via a sudo call:

<img src="/docs/img/add-BTC-USDT.png" alt="Add BTC-USDT" width="70%">
<img src="/docs/img/add-DOT-BTC.png" alt="Add DOT-BTC" width="70%">

Make sure to submit transaction for each:

<img src="/docs/img/submit-transaction.png" alt="Submit transaction" width="60%">

Validate algorithm produces DOT-USDT pair. Note, in case of negative graph cycles (which produces infinite arbitrage opportunities), the algorithm discards the price updates.

Firstly, monitor logs for price updates. 

![View price update logs](/docs/img/price-update-logs.png)

Check onchain storage for DOT-USDT price update. Go to chain state menu:

<img src="/docs/img/chain-state-menu.png" alt="Go to chain state menu" width="20%">

And validate new trading path for DOT-USDT pair:

## Outstanding questions
* Extrinsics with unbounded vector parameters (eg. `ocw_submit_best_paths_changes()`) - good idea? How to benchmark?
* Benchmarking utilizes `--wasm-execution interpreted-i-know-what-i-do` as default `compiled` isn't available...
* `submit_price_pairs()` allows unbounded vector, which suggests unbounded memory/weight resources. Research switching to a bounded vector data structure?
