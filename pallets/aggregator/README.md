# DeFI Aggregator pallet

This is an implementation of a DeFI aggregator, comprising:
- parametrizable longest path algorithm
- OCW worker fetching latest price data, run the longest path algorithm, record results via extrinsics
- extrinsic interface for:
  - internal usage, eg. recording of latest price data
  - admin/root, eg. addition/deletion of price pairs (by provider)
  - trading API utilizing the latest price data

## Details
This pallet comprises following structure:
```
  *
  |
  +---- lib.rs
  |
  +---- types.rs

  +---- utils.rs
  |
  +---- heap.rs

```
- [lib.rs](src/lib.rs) - OCW mechanisms and extrinsic APIs
- [types.rs](src/types.rs) - types utilized throughout
- [utils.rs](src/utils.rs) - common utils
- [heap.rs](src/heap.rs) - heap implementation
- [best_path_calculator/floyd_warshall](best_path_calculator/floyd_warshall) - implementation of a shortest/longest path algorithm, comprising:
  - Floyd-Warshall implementation as per https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNI0rf2P9gE&ab_channel=AbdulBari
  - longest path implementation with weight multiplications, as per https://www.coursera.org/lecture/algorithms-on-graphs/currency-exchange-reduction-to-shortest-paths-cw8Tm
- [trade_provider/crypto_compare] - price data fetcher, as lifted from OCW example

simple example, assumes only provided pairs are reachable

### Longest path algorithm
For longest path calculations, Floyd-Warshall algorithm was chosen for its ability to calculate shortest/longest paths across all vertices.

For multiplication based weights, it's been noticed that product maximisation is equivalent to maximisation of log of weights, as per: `x*y = 2^(log2(x) + log2(y))`.

For longest paths, weights have been multiplied by `-1` and hence reused in shortest path algorithm.

*NOTE:* Floyd-Warshall can detect negative path cycles (ie. infinite arbitrage opportunities), which cause the latest price update to be ignored. Potential FIXME - remove offending edge to remove negative cycles...

### OCW
OCW triggers price fetching, best path calculation, compares with currently stored best path and issues updates via unsigned root origin extrinsic.

OCW trigger is guarded by an `OffchainTriggerFreq` constant ensuring price fetching doesn't happen too frequently, as well as `AcceptNextOcwTxAt` storage / `UnsignedTxAcceptFreq` constant ensuring unsigned transactions are received too frequently.

### API
- admin (root origin)
  - `ocw_submit_best_paths_changes()` - for price change delta submissions from onchain
  - `add_price_pair()`/`delete_price_pair()`/`submit_price_pairs()` - for submission of to-be-monitored price pairs by provider
- public facing
  - `trade()` - to perform trade as per chosen trade path (not yet integrated with a provider)

### Storage
In flux, to-be-described...

### Events
In flux, to-be-described...

### Constants
- `OffchainTriggerFreq` - determines OCW trigger frequency
- `UnsignedTxAcceptFreq` - determines unsigned transaction receipt frequency
- `UnsignedPriority` - sets unsigned transaction priority (to play nicely with other pallets)
- `PriceChangeTolerance` - sets acceptable price change tolerance, if not breached, on-chain prices aren't updated

## Usage
```bash
make build                      # build pallet/runtime
make test                       # verify build
make clippy                     # ensure code quality

make run                        # start the project
make run-node                   # start the project, from pre-compiled node
sleep 15 && make populate-keys  # in another windowm, upload keys once the node stabilizes

```

Go to [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer). Ensure you've switched to local node:

Go to extrinsic menu to submit currency-provider pairs:

Notice how adding currency-provider pairs is a sudo call (requires going through `sudo` pallet):

<img src="/konrads/substrate-aggregator/raw/main/docs/img/add-DOT-BTC.png" alt="Add DOT-BTC" style="max-width: 70%;">

Make sure to submit transaction for each:

Validate algorithm produces DOT-USDT pair. Note, in case of negative graph cycles (which produces infinite arbitrage opportunities), the algorithm discards the price updates.

Firstly, monitor logs for price updates.

Check onchain storage for DOT-USDT price update. Go to chain state menu:

And validate new trading path for DOT-USDT pair:

## Outstanding questions
* Extrinsics with unbounded vector parameters (eg. `ocw_submit_best_paths_changes()`) - good idea? How to benchmark?
* Benchmarking utilizes `--wasm-execution interpreted-i-know-what-i-do` as default `compiled` isn't available...
